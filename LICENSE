Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                       Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share the software and to share in its changes. This license gives you the legal permission to do so.

Specifically, the GNU General Public License is designed to ensure that you have the right to:

1.  Run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
2.  Study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
3.  Redistribute copies so you can help others.
4.  Improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community can benefit.
    Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

To make this possible, everyone is granted certain essential freedoms, as defined in this license.

This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can use it for your own programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you are treated fairly if you distribute modified versions of the software.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. That means you must distribute the source code as well. And you must keep that license intact so that everyone else also has these freedoms.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license that gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

For the authors' and publishers' sake, we use the term "work" to refer to the software. This includes source code, object code, and any accompanying data or documentation.

The responsibilities of the users are outlined below. The details of how to apply the terms of this license can be found in the sections entitled "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs" and "GNU General Public License".

The rest of this License consists of the terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.


    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

    To "modify" a work means to copy it or adapt it to your needs.  You can modify the work in any way you want, including the way it looks, as long as you meet the requirements of this License.

    "You" means the person who receives a copy of the Program under this License.  "Your" has a corresponding meaning.

    "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For example, it includes the source code for a program, as well as any associated documentation.

    "Object Code" means any form of the work other than the Source Code.

    "Distribution" means any form of the distribution of the Program, including the original and any modifications to it, whether as a commercial product or not.

    "Modification" means any changes to the original Program that result in a new version of the Program.

    "GPL" refers to the GNU General Public License.

1. Source Code.

The GNU General Public License will require you to provide a license statement in any software you distribute, as well as provide a copy of the source code.

7. Running the Program.

The special exception allows you to distribute the Program as a whole. The exception is valid if you apply for a license in accordance with the terms of this License.
